# Location-Service-Platform

In view of the demand of positioning service on the market and its high deployment and maintenance cost at present, this paper has proposed the design scheme of the positioning service platform, providing web platform positioning service. 

The platform is based on the Beidou satellite navigation system, integrates satellite positioning, GSM communications technology and many more to design hardware, and the data is stored and transmitted through databases, wireless communications and AJAX, and finally displayed on the Web. 

The goal of the platform is to provide users with location inquiries, track queries, geofencing, route planning, data visualization and other services. Later we can also provide time prediction, driving behavior analysis and other big data features. 

Personal and business users just need to use the appropriate hardware so that they can be directly connected to the platform with convenience and reduced deployment costs, and it is conducive to the promotion of BeiDou satellite navigation system and SME business development.
